1st, Capsualization

Getter and Setter in Java have used from 90s to now.
Why are they use? Because of Capsualization!
Think about If you use a function not using getter and setter, then parameter is not secured!
Maybe other can be modified 'num' as arbitrarily!
Therefore, 'Num' should not be changeble but only constant variable. 

However, we can change 'n' as arbitrarily.
In Setter and Getter function, we can write it.

int InitNum(int num){
    int num;
} 


int Setter(int n)
{	num = n
	retrun 0;
} 

int Getter(){

	
	return n;
}
